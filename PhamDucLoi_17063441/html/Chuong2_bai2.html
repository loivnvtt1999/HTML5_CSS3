				<h2>Run the Messier Marathon</h2>
				<p>It's time for the annual Messier Marathon. Instead of lacing up their Nikes, amateur astronomers
				will be hauing telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the
				Messier objects.</p><br/>
				<p>Messier objects are stellar objects, classified by astronomer Charles Messier in the 18th century,
				ranging from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. Now is the only time of the year 
				in which all 110 Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you 
				have to start looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise -- hence the tern, 
				"marathon>."</p><br/>
				<p>Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made the list in order 
				to avoid seeing them. Messier was more interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar 
				objects kept getting in the way.</p><br/>
